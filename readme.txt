Welcome to my Sudoku solver. A given puzzle is sent to an API written in PHP and is solved
with a custom made algorithm. The result is then sent back to the client. If it is an invalid
puzzle the inputted puzzle will be highlighted red, otherwise the solved puzzle will be shown
with user inputs in black and solution cells in grey.
